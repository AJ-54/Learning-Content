# Instructions

1. Import the dataset into a matrix using **numpy**. The dataset is space delimited with first column as labels and rest 10 as features.

2. Plot all features vs each other (2 at a time) using **matplotlib**. red for label 1 and blue for label 2. clearly denote axes. title of the plot. and axes should have proper markings.

3. Find the **two features** which can classify the **two labels** perfectly.

4. **For the brave hearted (optional but with *bonus* points!): use scikitlearn to apply principal component analysis and the best two feature and check if they are same as you observed**. 

# Point System

10 points for achieving first *3 assignment sub-point each* (Total points = 30).

The bonus task weighs *50 points*.

*Independent self projects* will be given points based on discussion in the group.

The toppers of the *leaderboards* will be given prizes.
