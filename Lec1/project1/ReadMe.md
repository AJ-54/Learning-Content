1. Import into matrix using np

2. Plot all features vs each other using matplotlib. red for 1 and blue for 2. clearly denote axes. title of the plot. and axes should have proper markings.

3. Find the two features which can classify the two labels perfectly.

4. For the brave hearted (optional but with bonus points!): use scikitlearn to apply principal component analysis.
